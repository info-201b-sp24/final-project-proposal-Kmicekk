## Project Introduction: Digital Behavior and Mental Health

### Overview

In the digital age, social media has become a central part of everyday life for millions of people around the world. While it offers unprecedented opportunities for communication and information sharing, there is growing concern about its impact on mental health. Our project aims to analyze user behavior on social media platforms and assess its correlation with various mental health outcomes. By leveraging data from surveys and digital usage metrics, we intend to create an interactive web application that visualizes these relationships and provides insights into how digital habits influence mental well-being.

### Research Questions

1. **How does the amount of time spent on social media correlate with reported levels of anxiety and depression among different age groups?**
   - **Motivation**: With rising screen time, understanding its impact on mental health can help in developing guidelines for healthier social media consumption.
   - **Importance**: This question addresses public health concerns and can inform policy decisions regarding digital literacy and mental health support systems.

2. **What are the effects of social media interactions (likes, shares, comments) on the self-esteem of individuals?**
   - **Motivation**: Social validation is a significant aspect of social media usage; studying its effects on self-esteem can illuminate psychological impacts that may not be immediately apparent.
   - **Importance**: Insights from this analysis can aid mental health professionals in creating interventions that help users maintain healthy relationships with digital platforms.

3. **Does the nature of content consumed (positive vs. negative news) on social media affect the user’s mood and mental health status?**
   - **Motivation**: Exposure to different types of content could have varying impacts on mood, which in turn affects overall mental health.
   - **Importance**: Understanding these dynamics can help in curating healthier digital environments.

4. **Are there significant differences in mental health impacts between various social media platforms?**
   - **Motivation**: Different platforms have different user experiences and content types, which might influence mental health differently.
   - **Importance**: This question can guide users in choosing their digital environments more wisely and encourage platforms to modify features that may negatively affect mental health.

### Significance

This project will not only highlight key factors linking digital behavior to mental health but also empower users with knowledge to manage their digital interactions proactively. The insights derived from this study can be crucial for educators, policymakers, and mental health professionals as they develop more effective strategies to enhance digital well-being in society.

## Topic Description: Historical Climate Change Analysis

### Topic Overview

Our project focuses on the analysis of historical climate data, examining changes in temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events over the past century. Climate change is a multifaceted issue that influences numerous environmental, economic, and social sectors. By analyzing historical data, we aim to identify significant trends that can provide insights into the broader impacts of climate change.

### Related Work

Several researchers and organizations have previously conducted studies and developed projects analyzing various aspects of historical climate change data. These works form a foundation for our project, providing methodologies, datasets, and insights that we can draw upon.

1. **NASA’s Climate Change and Global Warming website** provides a comprehensive overview of climate change data, including temperature and precipitation changes over time. It hosts an extensive collection of resources, including visual data and scientific reports, which are instrumental for public understanding and educational purposes (NASA, 2021).
   - [NASA Climate Change](https://climate.nasa.gov/)

2. **"Global Temperature Change" by James Hansen et al.** (2010) offers an in-depth analysis of global temperature trends over the last century, utilizing data from multiple international datasets. This paper has been crucial in understanding temperature fluctuations and the role of anthropogenic factors in climate change.

3. **"Quantifying the Influence of Climate on Human Conflict" by Solomon Hsiang et al.** (2013), published in *Science*, explores the relationship between climate variables like temperature and precipitation with human conflict over historical periods. This research provides a unique perspective on how climate change impacts social structures and security.

These sources underscore the relevance and urgency of studying historical climate data to better predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change. By building on these foundational studies, our project aims to provide a more interactive and user-friendly approach to understanding these complex issues.
