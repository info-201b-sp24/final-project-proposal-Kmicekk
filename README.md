## Abstract

Our main question is, how does the amount of social media usage affect the user's mental health? This question is important because with the recent rise of social media users increasing, and the age of users becoming younger, having bad mental health at a younger age can hinder their growth in a bad way. We decided to touch on this topic since social media usage has increased over the years, and we believe it will only keep on increasing, leading to more people with mental health issues, and people with these mental health issues getting younger.

## Project Introduction: Digital Behavior and Mental Health

### Overview

In the digital age, social media has become a central part of everyday life for millions of people around the world. While it offers unprecedented opportunities for communication and information sharing, there is growing concern about its impact on mental health. Our project aims to analyze user behavior on social media platforms and assess its correlation with various mental health outcomes. By leveraging data from surveys and digital usage metrics, we intend to create an interactive web application that visualizes these relationships and provides insights into how digital habits influence mental well-being.

### Research Questions

1. **How does the amount of time spent on social media correlate with reported levels of anxiety and depression among different age groups?**
   - **Motivation**: With rising screen time, understanding its impact on mental health can help in developing guidelines for healthier social media consumption.
   - **Importance**: This question addresses public health concerns and can inform policy decisions regarding digital literacy and mental health support systems.

2. **What are the effects of social media interactions (likes, shares, comments) on the self-esteem of individuals?**
   - **Motivation**: Social validation is a significant aspect of social media usage; studying its effects on self-esteem can illuminate psychological impacts that may not be immediately apparent.
   - **Importance**: Insights from this analysis can aid mental health professionals in creating interventions that help users maintain healthy relationships with digital platforms.

3. **Does the nature of content consumed (positive vs. negative news) on social media affect the user’s mood and mental health status?**
   - **Motivation**: Exposure to different types of content could have varying impacts on mood, which in turn affects overall mental health.
   - **Importance**: Understanding these dynamics can help in curating healthier digital environments.

4. **Are there significant differences in mental health impacts between various social media platforms?**
   - **Motivation**: Different platforms have different user experiences and content types, which might influence mental health differently.
   - **Importance**: This question can guide users in choosing their digital environments more wisely and encourage platforms to modify features that may negatively affect mental health.

### Significance

This project will not only highlight key factors linking digital behavior to mental health but also empower users with knowledge to manage their digital interactions proactively. The insights derived from this study can be crucial for educators, policymakers, and mental health professionals as they develop more effective strategies to enhance digital well-being in society.

### Topic Description: Digital Behavior and Its Impact on Mental Health

## Topic Overview
Our project explores the intricate relationship between digital behavior on social media and its impact on mental health. The proliferation of digital platforms has transformed how we interact, obtain information, and perceive ourselves and others. However, the psychological effects of these changes are not fully understood. Our research aims to uncover patterns and consequences of social media usage that may affect mental health, drawing on existing studies and datasets to inform our analysis and conclusions.

These studies and articles provide a foundation for our research, offering insights into methodologies for data collection and analysis, as well as previous findings that we can build upon to further understand the relationship between social media usage and mental health. By integrating these perspectives, our project aims to contribute valuable new knowledge to this important field.


3. The Dataset

Find a dataset for your project idea. The dataset must include at least 200 observations (rows) and 5 features (columns), unless you consult with your TA and Prof. Gupta.

> Where did you find the data? Please include a link to the data source
> Who collected the data?
> How was the data collected or generated?
> Why was the data collected?
> How many observations (rows) are in your data?
> How many features (columns) are in the data?

> What, if any, ethical questions or questions of power do you need to consider when working with this data?

> What are possible limitations or problems with this data? (at least 200 words)

The data was found on Mendeley Data (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jxkcm7s638/1). The data was collected by John Ngugi from the Kisii University College Faculty of Health Sciences. This data was collected through online surveys performed by the Kisii University College Faculty of Health Sciences throughout the campus. This survey was done to determine participant behaviors on the subjects of mental health and how much they use social media as well as a score of social media’s impact on mental health. There are 300 observations (rows) in the data. There are six features (columns) in the data corresponding to the number of respondents, age, gender, frequency of social media interaction, self-reported mental health score, and impact on mental health score. In terms of ethical questions or questions of power, one thing to consider is the fact that this data only considers two genders, male or female, in its data. This could mean that those who identify as someone other than those two genders were excluded from this data, making it exclusive and unrepresentative of the whole population. Another thing to consider is that surveys are vulnerable to response bias and may not be representative of the whole population since they only contain willing respondents. Some possible limitations or problems of the data are the lack of specific information and its scale. The frequency of social media interaction and self-reported mental health scores are measured on a scale of only four levels which can be seen as restrictive. We are also limited to the fact that they are self-reported scores and are not reliable as an actual measure of the mental health of these respondents. 

4. Implications

> Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (at least 150 words)

Some possible implications of using this research are allowing technologists and designers to get a better understanding of how social media and screen time affect the mental health of the user. This might lead to figuring out a way to implement a better social media design that allows the user to engage with other people and enjoy their social media life by promoting mindful engagement, positivity, and diversity, but also limits their use to the right amount so it's not addictive and become harmful by developing activity tracker that encourages the user to take breaks and develop a healthy digital habit. This research can also inspire policymakers to establish new policies that allow for better ways to regulate these social media platforms to protect users from harmful or inappropriate content. They can also enact regulations that promote mental wellness by providing more accessible mental health resources and conducting surveys to measure the user. 

5. Limitations & Challenges
A challenge we might face in this data is that this data limited to a certain location so it might not be accurate to use as on a regional or global scale. We also are not sure what the mental health score implies, and the reports of people indicating their social media usage and mental health issue are a little broad, ranging from the description bad to excellent. Additionally, not having an age range can limit the overall accuracy of the data. We also do not know if they have a set time for social media usage, since different age ratings think differently on how much social media usage is a lot.
